# Techforcement Website Master Plan

This document outlines the high-level strategic phases for the design and development of the Techforcement company website.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup
- **Objective:** Establish the technical foundation of the project.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript.
  - Install and configure core dependencies: Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Framer Motion, Three.js (`@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`), and `react-hook-form`.
  - Establish a scalable project structure for components, pages, hooks, and utilities.
  - Set up deployment pipeline with Vercel.

## Phase 2: Core Identity & Design System
- **Objective:** Define and implement the visual identity of the brand.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Finalize the color palette (Primary, Secondary, Accent, Neutral) and configure it in `tailwind.config.ts`.
  - Select and integrate primary (Headings) and secondary (Body) fonts.
  - Create a set of reusable UI components (Buttons, Cards, Forms) based on the design system.

## Phase 3: Global Component Development
- **Objective:** Build site-wide elements that ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Develop the sticky `Header` component with navigation and a "Get a Quote" CTA.
  - Develop the `Footer` with all necessary links and information.
  - Create the initial `LoadingScreen` component featuring the GSAP text drawing animation.

## Phase 4: Page Development & Content Integration
- **Objective:** Build out the individual pages of the website with their core content and functionality.
- **Key Actions:**
  - **Home Page:** Develop all sections, including the hero, services overview, and case study showcase.
  - **Case Studies Page:** Create the main grid layout and the dynamic template for individual project pages.
  - **Tutorials Page:** Build the layout for tutorials and integrate the initial content, focusing on clear CTAs.
  - **Contact Page:** Implement the contact form and display contact information.
  - **Content Population:** Write and integrate all copy, ensuring it aligns with the E-E-A-T principles and brand persona.

## Phase 5: Advanced Animations & Interactivity
- **Objective:** Implement the sophisticated animations that will differentiate the site and showcase technical expertise.
- **Key Actions:**
  - **Home Page:** Implement the GSAP scroll-triggered text reveal and the Three.js 3D wave effect for service cards.
  - **Case Studies:** Implement the Three.js 3D interactive tilt effect on project cards.
  - **General UX:** Apply Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and micro-interactions on interactive elements.

## Phase 6: SEO & Performance Optimization
- **Objective:** Ensure the website is technically sound, fast, and optimized for search engines.
- **Key Actions:**
  - **On-Page SEO:** Implement keyword-optimized metadata (`title`, `description`), header tags, and image `alt` text across all pages.
  - **Technical SEO:** Generate and configure `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`. Ensure site is fully responsive.
  - **Performance:** Conduct a full Lighthouse audit. Optimize images (`.webp`), leverage Next.js features (code splitting, dynamic imports), and fine-tune Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS).

## Phase 7: Final Review, Testing & Launch
- **Objective:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure a flawless launch.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Cross-browser and cross-device testing.
  - Final content and copy review.
  - Submit sitemap to Google Search Console.
  - Deploy to production on Vercel and monitor performance.
