      challenge: "The client had an outdated website that was not mobile-friendly and had poor search engine visibility. They were not generating any leads from their online presence.",
      solution: "We created a professional, modern website that establishes a strong online presence tailored specifically for pursuing government contracts and bidding opportunities. The site emphasizes credibility, showcases qualifications, and presents the business as a reliable partner for municipal and state projects. We implemented strategic SEO targeting government procurement searches and integrated features that demonstrate the company's readiness for public sector work.",

      challenge: "The client wanted a simple way for customers to browse cabinetry and place orders by phone, but their existing site lacked a clear catalog and call-first ordering.",
      solution: "We designed a clean, mobile-first online catalog (no ecommerce). Each product page highlights finishes, sizes, and pricing guidance, and includes a prominent click-to-call button, business hours, and availability so customers can easily call to place orders or request a quote.",
      results: "The site now functions as an easy-to-use catalog with a phone-first ordering flow, improving customer confidence and making it straightforward to place orders by phone."

      challenge: "The client was managing all of their bookings manually, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. They needed a more efficient way to manage their appointments and communicate with customers.",
      solution: "We developed a custom booking system that allows customers to schedule appointments online and receive automated reminders. The system also includes a customer portal where they can view their upcoming appointments and payment history.",
      results: "The new booking system has saved the client an average of 10 hours per week in administrative work. It has also improved the customer experience, with a 95% customer satisfaction rating."

      challenge: "The construction bidding process is highly competitive and time-consuming. The client wanted to create a software solution that would help contractors save time and win more bids.",
      solution: "We developed an AI-powered SaaS platform that automates the bidding process. The platform uses machine learning to analyze project data and generate accurate bids in a fraction of the time it would take to do manually.",
      results: "The project is currently an MVP and not fully deployed. Early testing and prototypes aim to save contractors 3+ hours per bid on document preparation and 5+ hours per week searching for relevant bid opportunities once the platform is fully operational."
